There are the possibilities:

1.  If you have problem with my coding standard, naming standard, namespace standard or whatever standard there is, I offer you just one solution => go fuck yourself
2.  If you want to change real code but you are too lazy to write me a message first => fork this repository and do whatever you want
3.  If you want to change real code and you did write me a message and I like it => send pull request
